## Project Goals

1. **Theoretical Understanding:** Gain a solid understanding of fluid dynamics theory, including the Navier-Stokes equations and boundary conditions.
2. **CFD Solver Development:** Develop a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver to numerically solve the Navier-Stokes equations.
3. **Solver Validation:** Validate the solver by comparing results with analytical solutions or experimental data.
4. **Fluid Flow Scenarios:** Investigate various fluid flow scenarios like laminar and turbulent flows around objects or through channels. 
5. **Boundary Condition Handling:** Ensure proper handling of boundary conditions with appropriate assumptions.
6. **Solver Application:** Apply the developed solver to simulate fluid flow around a cylinder, through a pipe, or over an airfoil. Analyze and discuss results in terms of flow separation, pressure distribution, and other relevant parameters.

**Ultimately, this project aims to:**

* Provide a comprehensive understanding of fluid flow analysis using the Navier-Stokes equations.
* Demonstrate the practical application through CFD solver development and validation.
